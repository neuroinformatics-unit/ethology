:::{admonition} Use a conda environment
:class: note
To avoid dependency conflicts with other packages, it is best practice to install Python packages within a virtual environment.
We recommend using [conda](conda:) to create and manage this environment, as they simplify the installation process.
The following instructions assume that you have conda installed.

## Install the package

## Users
First clone the repository at the desired location:

```bash

Then create a conda environment and install the package from source
```sh
conda create -n ethology-env python=3.12 -y
conda activate ethology-env
cd ethology
pip install .
```

## Developers
