# ethology

[`ethology`](https://github.com/neuroinformatics-unit/ethology) is a Python package which aims to facilitate the application of a wide range of computer vision tasks to animal behaviour research, by providing a unified data analysis interface. We plan to support both classic computer vision tasks and deep learning based ones, such as background subtraction, object detection, ID tracking, segmentation, any-point tracking, and any useful combinations between them.
