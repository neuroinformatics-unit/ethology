# How to Contribute

## Create a development environment

We recommended using [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) to create a
development environment. In the following, we assume you have
`conda` installed.

To install `ethology` for development, first create and activate a `conda` environment:

```sh
conda create -n ethology-dev python=3.12
conda activate ethology-dev
```

Then install the development version of `ethology` by cloning the GitHub repository,
and pip-installing it in editable mode with the required dependencies:

```sh
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/neuroinformatics-unit/ethology.git

# then run from within the repository root folder:
pip install -e .[dev]  # works on most shells
pip install -e '.[dev]'  # works on zsh (the default shell on macOS)
```
This should install all the dependencies needed for development, such as `pytest` and `pre-commit`.

Finally, install the [pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com/):

```bash
pre-commit install
```

Pre-commit hooks are a set of tools that run automatically before each commit and help maintain a consistent formatting style in the code (see the section [pre-commit hooks](#formatting-and-pre-commit-hooks) below for more details).

## Pull requests

Please submit code to the main repository with a pull request (PR).
We follow our sister project [movement](https://github.com/neuroinformatics-unit/movement/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and adhere to the same conventions:

- Please submit _draft_ PRs as early as possible to allow for discussion.
- The PR title should be descriptive e.g. "Add new function to do X" or "Fix bug in Y".
- The PR description should be used to provide context and motivation for the changes - we use a template to help you with this.
- One approval of a PR (by a repository owner) is enough for it to be merged.
- Unless someone approves the PR with optional comments, the PR is immediately squash and merged by the approving reviewer.
- Ask for a review from someone specific if you think they would be a particularly suited reviewer.
- PRs are preferably merged via the ["squash and merge"](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/about-pull-request-merges#squash-and-merge-your-commits) option, to keep a clean commit history on the _main_ branch.

## Contribution workflow
A typical contribution workflow would be as follows:
* Locally, check out a new branch, make your changes, and stage them.
* When you try to commit, the [pre-commit hooks](https://github.com/neuroinformatics-unit/movement/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#formatting-and-pre-commit-hooks) will be triggered.
* Stage any fixes automatically made by the hooks, or fix any of them manually, and commit the changes.
* Make sure to add tests for any new features or bug fixes. See the [testing](#testing) section below.
* Don't forget to update the documentation, if necessary. This includes docstrings, README, and any other relevant documentation.
* Make sure that all tests pass locally before pushing your changes.
* Push your changes to GitHub and open a draft pull request, with a meaningful title and a thorough description of the changes.
* If all continuous integration (CI) checks run successfully (e.g. linting, type checking, testing), you may mark the pull request as ready for review and tag a reviewer.
* Once the reviewer has provided feedback, you will need to respond to the review comments and implement any requested changes.
* After the review feedback has been addressed, one of the repository maintainers will approve the PR and add it to the [merge queue](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-02-08-pull-request-merge-queue-public-beta/).
* Success ðŸŽ‰ !! Your PR will be (squash-)merged into the _main_ branch.


## Formatting and pre-commit hooks

Running `pre-commit install` will set up our [pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com/) - these are useful to ensure a consistent formatting style. Currently, our hooks run:
* [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff), which does a number of jobs, including code linting and auto-formatting.
* [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html), which does static type checking.
* [check-manifest](https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest), to ensure that the right files are included in the pip package.
* [codespell](https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell) to check for common misspellings.

You may also run the pre-commit hooks manually at any time using one of the following commands before committing:
```sh
pre-commit run  # applies to the staged files
pre-commit run -a  # applies to all files in the repository
```

To run the pre-commit hooks individually, you can run the following from the root of the repository:
```sh
ruff .
mypy -p ethology
check-manifest
codespell
```

Some problems will be automatically fixed by the hooks. In this case, you should stage the auto-fixed changes and run the hooks again to ensure that there are no further issues:
```sh
git add .  # stage all changes
pre-commit run
```

If a problem cannot be auto-fixed, the corresponding tool will provide
information on what the issue is and how to fix it. For example, `ruff` might
output something like:

```sh
ethology/io/load_bboxes.py:551:80: E501 Line too long (90 > 79)
```

This pinpoints the problem to a single code line and a specific [ruff rule](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/) violation.
Sometimes you may have good reasons to ignore a particular rule for a specific line of code. You can do this by adding an inline comment, e.g. `# noqa: E501`. Replace `E501` with the code of the rule you want to ignore.

For docstrings, we adhere to the [numpydoc](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) style.
Make sure to provide docstrings for all public functions, classes, and methods.
This is important as it allows for automatic generation of the API reference.

## Testing

We use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) for testing and aim for
~100% test coverage (as far as is reasonable).
All new features should be tested.
Write your test methods and classes in the _tests_ folder.

For some tests, you will need to use real data.
Please do not add sample data to the code repository, especially if they are large - we use an external data repository instead.
See the [sample data](#sample-data) section for more information.


## Continuous integration
All pushes and pull requests trigger a [GitHub actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) workflow. This is defined in the file at `.github/workflows/test_and_deploy.yml` and runs:
* Linting checks (pre-commit).
* Testing in different operating systems and Python versions (only if linting checks pass)
* A release to PyPI (only if a git tag is present and if tests pass).

## Versioning and releases
We use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), which includes `MAJOR`.`MINOR`.`PATCH` version numbers:

* PATCH = small bugfix
* MINOR = new feature
* MAJOR = breaking change

We use [setuptools_scm](https://setuptools-scm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to automatically version `ethology`.
It has been pre-configured in the `pyproject.toml` file.
`setuptools_scm` will automatically [infer the version using git](https://setuptools-scm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage#default-versioning-scheme).
To manually set a new semantic version, create a tag and make sure the tag is pushed to GitHub.
Make sure you commit any changes you wish to be included in this version. E.g. to bump the version to `1.0.0`:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Add new changes"
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Bump to version 1.0.0"
git push --follow-tags
```
Alternatively, you can also use the GitHub web interface to create a new release and tag.

The addition of a GitHub tag triggers the package's deployment to PyPI (see the [continuous integration](#continuous-integration) section).
The version number is automatically determined from the latest tag on the _main_ branch.

## Test data

We maintain some sample datasets to be used for testing on an
[external data repository](https://gin.g-node.org/neuroinformatics/ethology-test-data).
Our hosting platform of choice is called [GIN](https://gin.g-node.org).
GIN has a GitHub-like interface and git-like
[CLI](https://gin.g-node.org/G-Node/Info/wiki#how-do-i-start) functionalities.

Please refer to the [README](https://gin.g-node.org/neuroinformatics/ethology-test-data/src/master/README.md) in the data repository for more information on the datasets and how to access them.

### Fetching data
To fetch the data from GIN, we use the [pooch](https://www.fatiando.org/pooch/latest/index.html)
Python package, which can download data from pre-specified URLs and store them
locally for subsequent uses. It also provides some nice utilities,
like verification of sha256 hashes and decompression of archives.

### Adding new data
Only core `ethology` developers may add new files to the external data repository.
To add a new file, you will need to:

1. Create a [GIN](https://gin.g-node.org/) account
2. Ask to be added as a collaborator on the [ethology data repository](https://gin.g-node.org/neuroinformatics/ethology-test-data) (if not already)
3. Download the [GIN CLI](https://gin.g-node.org/G-Node/Info/wiki/GIN+CLI+Setup#quickstart) and set it up with your GIN credentials, by running `gin login` in a terminal.
4. Clone the `ethology` data repository to your local machine, by running `gin get neuroinformatics/ethology-test-data` in a terminal.
5. Add your new files as appropriate. Please follow the instructions in the [README](https://gin.g-node.org/neuroinformatics/ethology-test-data/src/master/README.md) and the existing file naming conventions as closely as possible.
6. Determine the sha256 checksum hash of each new file. You can do this in a terminal by running:
    ```bash
    sha256sum <filename>  # in Ubuntu
    shasum -a 256 <filename>  # in MacOS
    certutil -hashfile <filename> SHA256  # in Windows
    ```

    <!-- ::::{tab-set}
    :::{tab-item} Ubuntu
    ```bash
    sha256sum <filename>
    ```
    :::

    :::{tab-item} MacOS
    ```bash
    shasum -a 256 <filename>
    ```
    :::

    :::{tab-item} Windows
    ```bash
    certutil -hashfile <filename> SHA256
    ```
    :::
    :::: -->

    For convenience, we've included a `get_sha256_hashes.py` script in the [ethology data repository](https://gin.g-node.org/neuroinformatics/ethology-test-data). If you run this from the root of the data repository, within a Python environment with `ethology` installed, it will calculate the sha256 hashes for all files in the `test_data` folder and write them to the file named `files-registry.txt`.

7. Commit a specific file with `gin commit -m <message> <filename>`, or `gin commit -m <message> .` to commit all changes.

9. Upload the committed changes to the GIN repository by running `gin upload`. Latest changes to the repository can be pulled via `gin download`. `gin sync` will synchronise the latest changes bidirectionally.
