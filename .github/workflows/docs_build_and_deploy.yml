name: Docs Build and Deploy

# Generate the documentation on all merges to main, all pull requests, or by
# manual workflow dispatch. The build job can be used as a CI check that the
# docs still build successfully. The deploy job only runs when a tag is
# pushed and actually moves the generated html to the gh-pages branch
# (which triggers a GitHub pages deployment).

# The deploy job also runs when a push is made to the main branch or a manual
# workflow dispatch is made.
